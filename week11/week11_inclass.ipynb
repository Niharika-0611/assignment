        "# Week 11 In-Class Challenge\n",
        "\n",
        "This week, we are doing an in-class exercise.  This will be worth 5 extra credit points for each team that creates a successful solution that follows the programming guidelines we've established this semester.  All the requirements for this programming challenge are described below.  If you complete them all successfully, you will receive 5 points.  If you do not, you will receive 0 points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Work as a group.  You will all receive the same number of points.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",
        "1. Your code must be a function named `week11()` that takes no parameters\n",
        "2. Your `week11()` function must read this CSV from the internet and use it as input: https://hds5210-data.s3.amazonaws.com/Section111ValidICD10-Jan2024.csv\n",
        "  * This file has three columns: CODE, SHORT DESCRIPTION, LONG DESCRIPTION, and NF EXCL\n",
        "  * The NF EXCL indicates that this code is excluded from a \"no fault\" list related to workers compensation insurance claims\n",
        "3. Your `week11()` function must use Pandas functions to generate new columns and filter the dataframe using the following rules\n",
        "   * Create a new column called \"CODE TYPE\" that contains only the first character of the CODE column. For example if CODE=\"A001\" then CODE TYPE=\"A\"\n",
        "   * Create a new column called \"CODE NUM\" that contains only the numeric part of the CODE column and make it numeric. For example if CODE=\"A001\" then CODE NUM=1\n",
        "   * Some CODE NUM portions cannot be converted directly because the have an \"X\" in them.  Convert that \"X\" to a \".\" and then conver the CODE NUM to a numeric value.  For example if CODE=\"E1037X1\" then CODE NUM=1037.1\n",
        "   * Filter your results to only include those rows where NF EXCL=\"Y\"\n",
        "   * Sort your results in ascending order by CODE NUM and then by CODE TYPE\n",
        "4. Use the \"checker\" in the last cell to confirm that your results are correct.  If the checker gives any errors, you will receive no credit.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Submitting\n",
        "Submit the assignment by creating a folder called week11_inclass in the repository of one of the people in your group. At the top of your submission, enter the names of all of the people in your group..\n",
        "\n",
        "## Scoring Rubric\n",
        "If your code passes my checker included at the bottom of this page, each person on your team will earn 5 points.  If you code does not pass my checker, you will earn 0 points. This is \"all or nothing\" extra credit.\n",
